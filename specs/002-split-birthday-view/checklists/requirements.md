# Specification Quality Checklist: Split Birthday View

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: PASSED

All checklist items have been validated and passed. The specification is complete and ready for the next phase.

### Details

**Content Quality**: The spec focuses entirely on what users need (two sections for birthday display) and why (urgent vs. long-term planning) without mentioning any implementation technologies.

**Requirement Completeness**:
- All 13 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
- 6 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Edge cases cover boundary conditions (30-day cutoff, leap years, empty data, etc.)
- No clarification markers needed - all reasonable defaults are documented

**Feature Readiness**:
- 3 prioritized user stories (P1: upcoming birthdays, P2: all other birthdays, P3: responsive layout)
- Each story has 3-5 acceptance scenarios using Given-When-Then format
- Success criteria measure user-facing outcomes (time to find birthdays, layout functionality)
- Clear scope: restructure existing overview page into two sections

## Notes

The specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` to proceed with implementation planning.
