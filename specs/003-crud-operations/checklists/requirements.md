# Specification Quality Checklist: Birthday Entry Management (CRUD Operations)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - Specification is complete and ready for planning

**Validation Details**:
- All 16 checklist items passed validation
- Specification is written in plain language for non-technical stakeholders
- Requirements are clear, testable, and unambiguous
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- 3 user stories with priorities (P1-P3) and independent test scenarios
- 15 functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-015)
- 7 success criteria (SC-001 to SC-007)
- 7 edge cases identified
- Assumptions and dependencies clearly documented

**Next Steps**:
- Proceed to `/speckit.plan` for implementation planning
- No clarifications needed - all requirements are clear
