# Specification Quality Checklist: Optional BasicAuth Protection

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-30
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Clarifications Resolved âœ…

All clarifications have been resolved with user input (2025-10-30):

### Question 1: Default Credentials Behavior
**Decision**: Option B - Prevent application startup with error message
**Rationale**: Fail-fast security approach ensures credentials are never accidentally unset when BasicAuth is enabled.

### Question 2: Missing Credentials Configuration Error Handling
**Decision**: Option A - Prevent startup with clear error message
**Rationale**: Consistent with Q1 decision - ensures security is never accidentally bypassed.

## Notes

- **Constitutional Impact**: This feature conflicts with Constitution Principle V (No Authentication Required). The implementation plan MUST document this in the "Complexity Tracking" section and justify why optional authentication is necessary for expanded deployment scenarios.
- The specification is otherwise complete and ready for planning once clarifications are resolved.
- German localization requirement (Principle VI) is addressed in FR-011 for error messages.
