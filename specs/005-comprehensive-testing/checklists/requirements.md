# Specification Quality Checklist: Comprehensive Testing for Non-Visual Logic

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-30
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - *Note: Testing frameworks mentioned only as reasonable defaults in Assumptions section*
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs - *Developer as user for test infrastructure*
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders - *Technical stakeholder appropriate for testing feature*
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details) - *Note: Test coverage percentages are measurable outcomes, framework-agnostic*
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All quality checks passed

**Details**:
- Specification is complete and ready for planning phase
- All 5 user stories have clear acceptance scenarios
- 13 functional requirements with specific testable criteria
- 8 success criteria with measurable metrics
- Comprehensive edge case coverage (12 edge cases identified)
- Clear scope boundaries (visual testing explicitly excluded)
- Assumptions and dependencies well-documented

**Next Steps**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` phase
