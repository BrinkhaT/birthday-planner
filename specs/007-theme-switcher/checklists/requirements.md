# Specification Quality Checklist: Theme Switcher (Light/Dark Mode)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-05
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)
**Status**: ✅ PASSED - Ready for `/speckit.plan`

## Content Quality

- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows

## Validation Summary

**Validation Date**: 2025-11-05
**Result**: All checklist items passed

**Spec Highlights**:
- 3 prioritized user stories (P1: System Detection, P2: Manual Toggle, P3: Persistence)
- 10 functional requirements covering detection, toggle, persistence, and accessibility
- 6 measurable success criteria with specific performance metrics
- 5 edge cases identified
- Dependencies and assumptions clearly documented

**Next Steps**: Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` to create the implementation plan.
